===========

Verbatim is a jQuery plugin that allows deep-linking directly to content. When installed, website visitors will be able to highlight text content, generate a direct link to the content, and share the link via Twitter. When a user clicks on the generated link, the page will scroll and highlight the selected content. It's magic.


##Installation

Verbatim is available as a jQuery plugin. It is also available as a [wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org), and a [meteor.js package](http://atmosphere.js). 

First, ensure that jQuery included inside of the <head> tag.
