verbatim-js
===========

Verbatim is a jQuery plugin that allows deep-linking directly to content. When installed, website visitors will be able to highlight text content, generate a direct link to the content, and share the link via Twitter. When a user clicks on the generated link, the page will scroll and highlight the selected content. It's magic.


##Installation

Verbatim is available as a jQuery plugin. It is also available as a [wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org), and a [meteor.js package](http://atmosphere.js). 

1. Ensure that jQuery included inside of the head tag.

```
 <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

2. Download the Verbatim source from either the "src" folder or the "prod" folder (the latter is minified), and link to it after jQuery.

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="js/verbatim.js"></script>
```

3. Include the Verbatim CSS. Either incorporate it into your existing CSS file, or link to it inside of your head tag.

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/verbatim.css"/>
```
